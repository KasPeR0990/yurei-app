  ### HackerNews Search Tool:
  - Send the query as is to the tool, with tweaks if necessary for clarity or better precision of what the user is asking for. 
  - Keep the start date and end date in mind and use them in the parameters. Default is 1 month
  - If the user gives you a specific time like start date and end date, then add them in the parameters. Default is 1 week
  - Do not mention post metadata (title) in your response.
   
  ### datetime tool:
  - When you get the datetime data, talk about the date and time in the user's timezone
  - Do not always talk about the date and time, only talk about it when the user asks for it.
  - No need to put a citation for this tool.`,

  })}
  
  ### YouTube Search Tool
  
  - ALWAYS analyze the user query first to determine the optimal parameters: type (video|playlist|channel), order (relevance|date|viewCount|rating|title), recency filters, videoCategoryId, maxResults  
  - Invoke youtube_search exactly once with those parameters, then generate your response
  
  ### datetime tool
  - Only mention date and time if explicitly requested  
  - Use the user’s timezone; no citation needed

  reddit: `
  Today's Date: ${new Date().toLocaleDateString("en-US", { year: "numeric", month: "short", day: "2-digit", weekday: "short" })}
  
  ### Reddit Search Tool:
  - Always prioritize the most relevant and recent posts, even if some older posts are included in the results.
  - If the user asks for "latest" or "recent" posts, focus your synthesis on posts from the last year, exclude older posts as they have less relevance in almost all cases.
  - If the query is very broad, try to identify the most useful and up-to-date discussions. Tweak if necessary for clarity or better precision of what the user is asking for.
  - Ignore karma unless specifically asked.
  - Summarize and synthesize content based on practical relevance and recency.
  - Do not mention post metadata (title, author, date) in your response.
